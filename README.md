 # PFDMaker
**PFDMaker** is a suite of [B4J](https://www.b4x.com/b4j.html) applications to create, view or operate **P**rocess **F**low **D**iagrams (PFD).

Developed as a personal challenge (and for personal use) to create all kind of PFDs.
The main focus has been on **Chemical Engineering Diagrams**, but evolving for **Flowcharts** and more like **Electrical** shapes.

There are 4 applications:
* **PFDCreator** - create PFDs using objects drag & dropped on a canvas.
* **PFDViewer** - view PFDs created by the PFDCreator.
* **PFDOperator** - operate or control PFDs created by the PFDCreator.
* **PFDShapeMaker** - create object shapes used by the PFDCreator (not started).

ðŸš§ The **PFDMaker** developments are in progress, but decided to share the source code of the B4J project **PFDCreator**.  
The source code of this B4J project can found in the archive pfdcreator.zip and it requires the [B4J](https://www.b4x.com/b4j.html) to run.

## PFDCreator
An application to create all kind of simple **P**rocess **F**low **D**iagrams (PFDs) using objects (shapes) which are dragged & dropped on a Drawing Board (Canvas).
A PFD contains objects which are shapes with properties.
The properties define the object shape position, size, colors, text & format, but also its value, unit, operate flag and more.
There are a number of predefined shapes, the basic shapes but also dedicated shape types to create flowcharts, process instrumentation & piping diagrams or electrical circuits.

### PFD Shape Types
The PFDCreator has initially following shape types:
* **Basic** - Common shapes which can be used by all PFD types.
* **Flowchart** - Shapes, like terminator, process, decision used to create flowcharts.
* **PID** - Shapes for Process Instrumentation & Piping (PID) diagrams.
* **Electrical** - Shapes to create electrical circuit diagrams.

**Notes**
* The PFDCreator application is provided as a B4J project with source code which requires [B4J](https://www.b4x.com/b4j.html) to run (Windows).
* The PFDCreator has been evolved from the idea to create simple PIDs. The application has become rather complex and has room for improvements.
* The included predefined shapes, created as methods use different ways to draw on the canvas. This is because evolving how to draw shapes. Considering using B4XPath as method only.
* To enhance the PFDCreator with more shape types and shapes, lookup the development notes (DEVNOTES.md).
* This B4J project is provided AS-IS and be aware that developments are ongoing which might lead to concept or code changes.
