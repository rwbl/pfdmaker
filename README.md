PFDMaker is a suite of B4J applications to create, view or operate Process Flow Diagrams (PFD).

The main focus has been on [I]Chemical Engineering diagrams[/I], but evolving for [I]Flowcharts[/I] and more to like [I]Electrical[/I] shapes.

There are 4 applications:


* [B]PFDCreator [/B]- create PFDs using objects drag & dropped on a canvas
* [B]PFDViewer [/B]- view PFDs created by the PFDCreator
