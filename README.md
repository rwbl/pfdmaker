# PFDMaker
**PFDMaker** is a suite of [B4J](https://www.b4x.com/b4j.html) applications to create, view or operate **P**rocess **F**low **D**iagrams (PFD).

Developed as a personal challenge (and for personal use) to create all kind of PFDs.
The main focus has been on **Chemical Engineering diagrams**, but evolving for **Flowcharts** and more like **Electrical** shapes.

There are 4 applications:
* **PFDCreator** - create PFDs using objects drag & dropped on a canvas.
* **PFDViewer** - view PFDs created by the PFDCreator.
* **PFDOperator** - operate or control PFDs created by the PFDCreator.
* **PFDShapeMaker** - create object shapes used by the PFDCreator (not started).

ðŸš§ The developments are in progress, but decided to share the source code of the B4J project **PFDCreator**.
The source code of this B4J project can found in the archive pfdcreator.zip and it requires the [B4J](https://www.b4x.com/b4j.html) IDE.

## PFDCreator
An application to create all kind of simple **P**rocess **F**low **D**iagrams (PFDs) using objects (shapes) which are dragged & dropped on a Drawing Board (Canvas).
A PFD contains objects which are shapes with properties.
The properties define the object shape position, size, colors, text & format, but also its value, unit, operate flag and more.
There are a number of predefined shapes, the basic shapes but also dedicated shape types to create flowcharts, process instrumentation & piping diagrams or electrical circuits.
